ECE 5760 Final Project: Modeling Thermal Distribution

Hi! If you want to run the Graphics Tests, you need GLUT and OpenGL. 
Just update the bash scrip with the location of these two libraries with <your path>:
g++ heat.cpp -o heat -framework GLUT -L"<your path>" -framework OpenGL -L"<your path>" 

Run the bash script by typing "./build.sh" into the terminal, and then follow the prompt asking for the size of the grid.
